# WGU-D287
Java Frameworks

Introduction

Throughout your career in software design and development, you will be asked to create, customize, and maintain applications with various features and functionality based on business requirements. For this assessment, you will customize a Spring Framework application with an HTML front-end and a Java backend using the solution statements provided in the requirements section of this assessment.

The skills you showcase in your completed application will be useful in responding to technical interview questions for future employment. This application may also be added to your portfolio to show to future employers.

For this project, you will use the Integrated Development Environment (IDE) link in the web links section of this assessment to install the IDE, IntelliJ IDEA (Ultimate Edition). You will sign up for a free student license using your WGU.edu email address. Please see the “IntelliJ Ultimate Edition Instructions” attachment for instructions on how to do this. You will also use the GitLab link in the web links section to obtain the template code for this project, please review the “GitLab How-To” web link prior to starting your work. Next, you will clone your GitLab repository and open it in IntelliJ IDEA (Ultimate Edition).

Scenario

You are working for a company that licenses and customizes a software application to keep track of inventory in stores. Your job as a software developer is to customize this application to meet a specific customer’s needs. You will choose any type of customer you would like, but it must sell a product composed of parts. An example of products versus parts would be a customer that’s a bicycle shop: a bicycle is a product, and a set of two matching wheels is a part (do not use the bicycle shop example in your project).

You have been provided with a Spring application with a Java backend, a generic HTML user interface to use in the design and development of the system, and a UML class diagram to assist you in your work (see the attached “UML Class Diagram”). You can find a user guide to help assist with the inventory management application in the attachments (see “Shop Inventory Management User Guide”).
